# Best Practices with Bedrock and GitOps

## TLDR
+ Use high-level definition repo as application configuration as code
+ Use Bedrock deployment templates as your declarative infrastructure as code.
+ All operational changes are made by pull request
+ Don't publish changes to the cluster by hand or via CI tools (helm/tiller)
+ Practice container image promotion. 
 + Build once and promote to environments via testing gates
+ Promotion is logged in high level definition

## Securing the Bedrock GitOps Workflow (TODO)
In a production scenario it can be tempting to modify Kubernetes resource directly on the cluster via kubectl, kubernetes dashboard, or helm via tiller. Some thoughts running through an operator's head may include:
+ Time is of the essence, I must make changes directly on the cluster. 
+ The gitops workflow is too cumbersome, I will make changes directly to the manifest yaml repository

At the moment these thoughts can seem reasonable; in the long run they can be disastrous. The reason for this isâ€¦

## Branch Policies (TODO)

## Rollbacks
Sometimes changes to your application configuration can yield undesired results. Having the ability to easily rollback to a previous state application code configuration is a must have. We recommend a few options to accomplish rollbacks.

A few options:

+ Create a new commit to your HLD to reverse rollback application changes
    + This is probably the easiest and most straightforward approach. 
+ Use `git reset --hard (COMMIT_ID)` command to revert the undesired `COMMIT_ID`
    + This will alter the history of your git repo and might not be the most transparent approach as to what actually may have happened on your cluster.
+ Use `git revert HEAD` to create a new commit with the inverse of the last commit
    + This command allows you to see that a something was reverted in the git history

### Scenarios (TODO)
+ Rolling back a promoted container
+ Multi-cluster rollbacks
+ Ensuring created cluster resources are removed
    + Flux garbage collection

## GitOps Checklist (TODO)
- [ ] Are you using branch policies on your high-level definition and manifest repos?
- [ ] Are you using container promotion?
- [ ] Are you locking high-level definition subcomponents to a version?
